# GA: The Greedy Algorithm

Several state-of-the-art proximity graph algorithms, such as NSSG, NSG, and HNSW, adopt a straightforward GA as their routing strategy throughout the whole routing process. But this leads to two problems: low routing efficiency and local optimum. TOGG alleviated these two problems, thus it achieves better performance of efficiency and effectiveness than the GA.
